    A new opera about an American family wrongfully imprisoned in 1942 and the
    power of collective resistance to injustice.
    </b>
    </p>

    <p>
    In 1942, during World War II, 120,000 people of Japanese
    ancestry—two-thirds of whom were American citizens—were unjustly
    incarcerated in concentration camps within the United States.
    </p>

    <p>
    This world premiere contemporary opera tells the moving story of the
    Shimono family, Japanese Americans forcibly removed from their suburban
    home in Southern California. After Mas, a fisherman and the head of the
    household, is arrested by the FBI on suspicion of espionage, the family is
    reunited in a desolate incarceration camp. As the family struggles to
    survive the emotional and physical toll of their wrongful imprisonment,
    this poignant, new opera illuminates the remarkable strength of familial
    bonds and the power of collective resistance in the face of injustice.
