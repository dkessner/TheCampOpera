    <p>
    Blending evocative music, rich storytelling, and stunning visuals, this
    brand new opera promises to be a transformative experience! 
    </p>

    <p>
    This production is a labor of love and shares a significant moment in U.S.
    history that is not widely known. The Camp allows us to bring this story to
    life—from one sentence in our history books to a full story centered around
    a Japanese American family’s experience in America’s concentration camp
    during WWII.
    </p>

    <p>
    Although the support we have received so far has been generous, we still
    need your support. Your contribution will help fund everything from set
    construction to rehearsals with world-class performers. Every donation—big
    or small—plays a vital role in making this production a reality.
