    <b>ACT I. Prologue:</b> A Commentator frames the backdrop
    as World War II. Scene 1 is on Evacuation Day in February
    1942. The Shimono family is packing and the FBI appears and
    arrests the father, Mas, who is a fisherman on the West
    Coast, and therefore suspected of spying for Japan.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Scene 2</b> takes place nine months later, after Haruko and her
    daughters, Suzuko and Rebecca, were interned at the Santa
    Anita Racetrack and have moved to a small room at a
    “permanent camp.” Friends visit; Mr. Tana arrives with news
    that Mas has arrived, and the family clusters joyously
    around him.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Scene 3</b> is in the kitchen messhall where Mas is
    working as a cook. Taylor, the Camp Administrator and PFC
    Parker visit and Kenji, a kitchen worker, reports sugar
    missing.  Taylor orders the inmates to clear the woods for
    fuel or freeze. Then the Supervisor, Edwards, arrives with
    the supply order list. After he leaves there is discord
    among the workers, for the kitchen is short staffed. Suzy
    and her friend Nobu take a break outside to escape the
    stress and discuss their hopes for a future, Suzy as a
    sugar beet worker and Nobu as an Army recruit. Mas forbids
    Suzy to see Nobu, out of fear he will die in the war.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Scene 4</b> is at the end of December at a surprise birthday party for Rebecca, who is turning
    12. They sing Happy Birthday and a Japanese song, she dances and begins to cough, for she
    has not gotten over the pneumonia she got at Santa Anita racetrack. Act I ends.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Act II, Scene 1</b> moves to 1943, when the Japanese Americans are confronted with the
    Loyalty Oath, Questions 27 and 28 forswearing allegiance to any other government but the
    US. At the opening of the scene Suzy and Nobu are alone sharing con idences. Nobu is
    elated because he will join the all Japanese American regiment, the 442nd. Suzy says she
    will be leaving to work on a sugar beet farm. Nobu then shocks her by asking her to marry
    him. Mas approaches and Nobu leaves. Mas talks to Suzy about Nobu’s enlistment. Mas says
    he opposes the fascism in Japan, but warns Suzy that Nobu may be killed in the war. Suzy
    leaves and Haruko enters. Mas drinks a lot of sake and objects to Haruko’s new ‘perm’ hair.
    He quarrels and grabs her hair. When Haruko protests, Mas reveals his despair because he
    has lost authority in the chaos of the camp. He feels Suzy will never come back. Haruko
    defends Suzy. Mas says no one listens to him anymore. Then he grabs her, confessing that
    she was right and he was wrong and begs her forgiveness. Suzy returns and reconciles with
    her father. He says he has nothing but the family. In the next scene,

    <b>Scene 2,</b> we find Mas in the kitchen. He catches
    Edwards stealing a bag of sugar, who offers him a kickback
    in return for silence. They fight and Kenji walks in.
    Edwards vows revenge and leaves. Kenji rings the messhall
    bells and calls the crew. Just as Edwards promised, PFC.
    Parker appears informing Mas he has been charged with a
    crime and has a hearing scheduled with the Camp
    Administration. Kenji then addresses the workers, and asks
    if they want to let Mas get arrested. They respond with
    shouts of “No! No!”
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Scene 3</b> is the next day, when Haruko
    comes home from work with hot tea for Rebecca.  Rebecca is
    in bed and can’t wake up; she doesn’t move. She has died
    during the day. Haruko screams. Mas enters and Haruko sends
    him to the infirmary. PFC. Parker appears, reminding Mas of
    his appointment with Camp Administration. Mas tells him to
    get out. The scene fades to Funeral services led by the
    Buddhist reverend, with the family and friends gathered for
    a memorial.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Scene 4</b> takes place the morning of Mas’s hearing. He
    waits for Tana. Haruko is terri ied Mas will be arrested
    again.  Mas says they must light a candle for the soul of
    Rebecca and he wants to struggle so that no more children
    will die from the terrible conditions in camp.  Haruko then
    agrees to go along with the kitchen workers’ plan. Tana
    arrives and explains they will surround the administration
    building if they try to arrest Mas. Mas declares he is
    ready and they leave for the hearing. This is the end of
    Act II. A short Epilogue follows, with the cast onstage
    with Commentator for the finale.
